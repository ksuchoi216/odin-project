# Flex practices

The following paractices will be solved in each section of html body tag .

1. center this div

This one is simple, but it's something that you'll want to do ALL THE TIME. Might as well get it out of the way now.

All you need to do is center the red div inside the blue container.

2. basic header
   
Use flexbox rules to create this very common webpage header style. The benefit to using flex here is that everything should be flexible. Check out the two screenshots below to get an idea of how it should scale with your screen. Besides flex rules, you'll also want to add some rules for margin and padding. (Hint: uls have some default margin/padding that you will need to deal with.)
